# Reactive Preferences Toolbox

A collection of libraries to allow `SharedPreferences` to be reactive

This library was created to continue improving on the great work that [@f2prateek](https://github.com/f2prateek) had done with [rx-preferences](https://github.com/f2prateek/rx-preferences).

In order to handle the varying number of reactive frameworks available, there are multiple libraries available, which all share the same basic APIs and adapters.

## Available Reactive SharedPreferences Libraries

- [Coroutine/Flow](./coroutine/README.md)
- [LiveData](./livedata/README.md)
